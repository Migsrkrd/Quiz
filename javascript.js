//var declaration/document linking
    //var time remaining
    //

//make array of objects (object = question: "", answer: "", wrong answers:"")

//set up function for START QUIZ button

//button.eventListener("click", gamestart) ?

//listen for button start

//first question and answer should be display now, as well as timer is set

//add eventListeners to answer options and check for true or false
    //use if right, move onto function that goes to next question
    //use if wrong, move onto function that goes to next question as well as decrement time

//write a function for wrong and decrement timer by 10 seconds

//use event listeners and once an answer is chosen, go to next question regardless 
//(set this process by setting an interval of the object array containing questions answers and wrong answers)
//kinda like the carrousel box example

//make a total of 6 questions
    //if last question or timer end, finish quiz and bring up last page
    

//repeat unntil timer hits 0 or all questions are all done
    //when our array of objects returns as undefined or length-1 for index

//endgame
    //stop timer and keep stopped time displayed
    //disaply the score at the end, which is the amount of time left on the timer
    //prompt for initials
    //save score and initials as (initials: score)
